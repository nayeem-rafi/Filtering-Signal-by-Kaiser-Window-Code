# Filtering Signal by Keiser Window (Code)
 This project demonstrates the design and application of Low-Pass, High-Pass, Band-Stop, and Band-Pass Filters using a Kaiser Window in MATLAB. Users can create custom FIR filters with precise control over parameters like passband width and side lobe attenuation.
